.SH NAME
sb-download - Spacebattles post downloader.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sb-download [-fv]
.I source_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
sb-download is a program to download specific posts 
from the Spacebattles forums.
It accepts a properly formatted file (see 
.B FILE FORMAT
below), and downloads the requested posts.
These are then compiled into several interlinked html files,
along with an index, 
and stored in a chosen folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -f
Forces updates. By default, sb-download will not download a post
if the next post in the source file is already downloaded.
While this is useful for updating on-going stories
or interrupted downloads,
it is not always reliable.
Using the
.B -f
tag indicates that all listed posts should be downloaded,
regardless of whether or not they already are.
.TP
.B -v
Sufficient Velocity option.
Instead of downloading from Spacebattles,
sb-download will instead download from sufficientvelocity.com.
